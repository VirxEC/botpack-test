# RLBot v5 botpack

A collection of ready-to-use bots made by the community.

To be a part of the pack, you just need to create a pull request with your bot to this repository.

## Bob

[Bob the bot builder](https://github.com/swz-git/bob) is the tool used by the botpack to build, package, and generate incremental patches for the botpack.
For this reason, your bot must have a properly configured `bob.toml` that allows Bob to build your bot.

For examples on how to use Bob, see <https://github.com/swz-git/bob-example>.
